# Crawling From Web

## Choosing seed URLs

Seed URLs are the starting points for a web crawler. They are the URLs from which the crawler will start navigating the web.
The selection of seed URLs is crucial for the success of the crawling process.
Here are some strategies for choosing seed URLs:

1. **Starting from a known website**: If you are interested in crawling a specific website, you can start with the homepage or any other page on that site.
2. **Starting from a search engine**: You can start with the search results of a search engine query related to your topic of interest.
3. **Starting from a list of URLs**: You can provide a list of URLs that you want the crawler to start from.
4. **Starting from a sitemap**: If the website has a sitemap, you can start from the URLs listed in the sitemap.
