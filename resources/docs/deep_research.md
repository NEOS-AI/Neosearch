# Deep Research

OpenAI's Deep Research is a powerful research tool for generating high-quality research reports.
It is empowered by the reasoning models like O1 and O3.

## Sample projects

- [Ollama-deep-researcher](https://github.com/langchain-ai/ollama-deep-researcher) is an AI-powered research assistant tool that uses langchain and langraph
- [deep-research](https://github.com/dzhng/deep-research) is a research assistant tool that uses GPT O1 and firecrawl
- [local-deep-research](https://github.com/LearningCircuit/local-deep-research)
- [deep-searcher](https://github.com/zilliztech/deep-searcher)

## Specifications

- As an end-user, I want deep-research to be able to generate research reports with reasoning models
- As an end-user, I want deep-research to answer in same language that I asked the question
- As an end-user, I want to export the research result as PDF, etc
- As an end-user, I am expecting the research agent to use Corrective RAG for better answer
- As an end-user, I am expecting the research agent to generate neat output (i.e. no duplicated sentences, concise, with nice table for comparison, etc)
