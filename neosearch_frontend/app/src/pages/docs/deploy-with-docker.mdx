# Deploy with Docker & Docker Compose

This document provides instructions for deploying the entire RAG using Docker Compose.

## Deploy

> **Prerequisites:**
>
> 1. Set up a [TiDB Serverless cluster](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidbcloud/tidb-cloud-quickstart).
> 2. Install [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/pingcap/autoflow.git;
    cd autoflow/;
    ```

2. Select an embedding model for pingcap/autoflow.

    We recommend using the OpenAI text-embedding-3-small model for autoflow, but you can also use other supported embedding models.

    - OpenAI
        - text-embedding-3-small
            - EMBEDDING_DIMS: 1536
            - EMBEDDING_MAX_TOKENS: 8191
    - JinaAI
        - jina-clip-v1
            - EMBEDDING_DIMS: 768
            - EMBEDDING_MAX_TOKENS: 8192
        - find more models in https://jina.ai/embeddings/
    - ZhipuAI
        - embedding-3
            - EMBEDDING_DIMS: 2048
            - EMBEDDING_MAX_TOKENS: 8192
        - Find more details in https://open.bigmodel.cn/dev/api/vector/embedding-3
    - Local Embedding Server
        - BAAI/bge-m3
            - EMBEDDING_DIMS: 1024
            - EMBEDDING_MAX_TOKENS: 8192

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

<Callout>
Note: You cannot change the embedding model after deployment because different models have varying vector dimensions and generate different vectors for the same input text.
If you want to use a different embedding model after deployment, you need to recreate the app and database.
</Callout>

3. Copy and edit the `.env` file:

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    vim .env # or use another text editor to edit this file
    ```

    Replace the following placeholders with your own values:
    - `SECRET_KEY`: you can generate a random secret key using `python3 -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))"`
    - `TIDB_HOST`, `TIDB_USER`, `TIDB_PASSWORD` and `TIDB_DATABASE`: get them from your [TiDB Serverless cluster](https://tidbcloud.com/)
      - Note: TiDB Serverless will provide a default database name called `test`, if you want to use another database name, you need to create a new database in the TiDB Serverless console.
      - Note: Don't use '#' in the password, it will cause an error when connecting to the database. See [issue](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/issues/8061).
    - `EMBEDDING_DIMS` and `EMBEDDING_MAX_TOKENS`: set them according to the embedding model you choose before, it can not be changed after the deployment.

4. Migrate the database schema:

    ```bash
    docker compose run backend /bin/sh -c "alembic upgrade head"
    ```

5. Bootstrap the database with initial data:

    ```bash
    docker compose run backend /bin/sh -c "python bootstrap.py"
    ```

    Running the bootstrap script creates an admin user. You can find the username and password in the output.

6. Start the services:

    ```bash
    docker compose up
    ```

    To use the local embedding model, start with the following command:

    ```bash
    docker compose --profile local-embedding-reranker up
    ```

7. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to access the web interface.

That's it! You can now use pingcap/autoflow locally. You can also go to https://tidb.ai to experience the live demo.


## Configuration

After you deploy the tool, you need to initialize the tool by following the popup wizard. The wizard will guide you through the following steps:

* Set up the default LLM model.
* Set up the default Embedding model.
* Set up `Data Source` to index the data.

## Upgrade

This section will help you upgrade pingcap/autoflow to the new version.

Suppose you want to upgrade pingcap/autoflow from 0.1.0 to version 0.2.0

1. Edit your docker-compose.yml file to use the new image version.

    ```yaml
    services:
      backend:
        image: tidbai/backend:0.2.0
      frontend:
        image: tidbai/frontend:0.2.0
      background:
        image: tidbai/backend:0.2.0
    ```

2. Pull the new image:

    ```bash
    docker compose pull
    ```

3. Migrate the database schema:

    ```bash
    docker compose run backend /bin/sh -c "alembic upgrade head"
    ```

4. Recreate the docker containers:

    ```bash
    docker compose up -d --force-recreate
    ```

5. Check the logs to ensure everything is working correctly:

    ```bash
    docker compose logs -f
    ```

6. Done!
