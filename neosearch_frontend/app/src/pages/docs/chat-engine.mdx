# Configure Chat Engine

Chat Engine is a set of configurations that allow you to customize the chat experience for your users. You can configure the chat engine to use different models for generating responses, reranking results, and more.

## Step by Step

1. Go to the admin panel.
2. Click on the `Chat Engines` tab.
3. As a chat engine consists of too many configurations, we provide a `Clone` button to help you create a new chat engine based on an existing one.
4. After clone a chat engine, you can edit the configurations and click `Save` button to save the changes.

5. You can also change the prompt to customize the chat experience for your users. The prompt is the message that the chatbot sends to the user to start the conversation.
