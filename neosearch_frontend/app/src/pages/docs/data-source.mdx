# Add Data Source

In order to provide answers to users, you need to add data source to the tool. The data source can be your own docs, knowledge base, etc.

Currently we support the following data sources:
* Markdown, HTML, PDF, etc.
* Website's SiteMap, if you have a website, you can use the SiteMap to add data source. pingcap/autoflow will crawl the website and index the data automatically.
* Single URL, you can add a single URL as data source.


## Step by Step

2. Click on the `Data Sources` tab;

4. Input your data source information and click `Create Data Source` button, then the tool will start indexing the data;
5. After adding data source, there will be a period of time for the tool to index the data. During this time, the tool will not be able to provide answers to users. You can go to `Index Progress` tab to check the indexing progress.
