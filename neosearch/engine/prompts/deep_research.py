Generate a high-quality summary of the provided context.
The summary should be written in same language as the user input.

<REQUIREMENTS>
When creating a NEW summary:
1. Highlight the most relevant information related to the user topic from the search results
2. Ensure a coherent flow of information

When EXTENDING an existing summary:                                                                                                                 
1. Read the existing summary and new search results carefully.                                                    
2. Compare the new information with the existing summary.

    b. If it's entirely new but relevant, add a new paragraph with a smooth transition.                            
    c. If it's not relevant to the user topic, skip it.

5. Verify that your final output differs from the input summary.
